# Marketing Analytics Assignment 

MSc Business Analytics Assignment: Evaluating the impact of hired salespeople on espresso machine sales using a Multilevel Scan*Pro model. 

## Project Description 

The objective of this project was to provide actionable insights for a consumer electronics brand featured in mass retail stores. The focus was on assessing the effectiveness of employing salespeople to promote products in these stores. A SCAN*PRO model was built in R to quantify the strategy's impact, and due to the client's presence in over 100 stores, a multilevel adaptation was used to accommodate store-level variations. The analysis concentrated on espresso machine sales data and revealed a positive link between salesperson presence duration and average weekly store sales. The study concluded by evaluating and discussing the added sales and profitability from the salesperson initiative.
